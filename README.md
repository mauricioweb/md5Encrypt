md5Encrypt
==========

We have 2 tests. The first with the default implementation, we need to implement the convertor from byte[] to Hex. The second test, we are using a lib org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils that does all for you. Just call static method with String that you want to encrypt.

[See documentation](http://commons.apache.org/codec/apidocs/org/apache/commons/codec/digest/DigestUtils.html)
